Hello!
My name is Lonely and I am glad you found this DBSA Mood Crew
workbook! My friends and I created this workbook for children to better
understand emotions.

The DBSA Mood Crew has a lot of experience with emotions, so we put
our heads together to create games, worksheets, and activities that will
illustrate what we are all about. Adults may find these activities and games
helpful tools to start talking about emotions with children. (Adults have
fun with this, too!)

If you have ever met my friend Angry, you’ll know that some emotions can
be difficult. However, once you get to know Angry better, you might realize
that we all feel that way sometimes. The DBSA Mood Crew wants everyone
to know that it is okay to feel all kinds of emotions. The more you get to
know us, the better you will be able to recognize who we are and when you
feel like we do.
I am really not great at making friends, so I hope it’s not too forward to ask
if you’d join me in exploring this DBSA Mood Crew workbook. If you are
ready, come and get to know us better!
